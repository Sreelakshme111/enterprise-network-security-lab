Enterprise Network Security Lab

Project Objective



This project simulates a secure enterprise network environment using VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, a hardened Ubuntu web server, and intrusion detection monitoring.



The objective is to demonstrate practical skills in networking, Linux administration, and security monitoring.
